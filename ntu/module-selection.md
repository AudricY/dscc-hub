# Module Selection (STARs)

Before every semester, NTU students need to plan the modules (mods) they'll be taking. Successfully securing the desired mods requires a combination of luck, skill, and a solid internet connection. Experience improves proficiency in this process.

## The Basics

1. **Single Major Students**: Register for two types of mods:
   - Core Modules and Major Prescribed Electives (MPE)
   - General Education Requirement Prescribed Electives (GERPE) and Unrestricted Electives (UE)
   
   **Double Major/Degree Students**: Usually, all mods are core/MPE.

2. **Finding Mods**: 
   - Search online for your major's modules (e.g., "NTU psychology modules").

3. **Registration**: 
   - Register for the mod+index. An index represents a timeslot or venue. 
   - Example: Registering for HP2100 could mean choosing between 19725 (10:30 - 11:30 AM) or 19726 (11:30 AM - 12:30 PM).

4. **Immediate Allocation**: 
   - Core/MPE registration results are immediate.
   - GERPE/UE registration places you on a waitlist, with allocation based on priority.

5. **Priority for GERPE/UE**:
   - Priority order: Major, Minor, Y4, Y3, Y2, Y1.

6. **Declaring a Minor**:
   - Declare early for priority in mod allocation. Minor mods count as UEs.
   - Complete minor requirements to graduate with the minor.

7. **Course Summary**:

## Planning

1. **Core/MPE Planning**:
   - Plan core/MPE mods first, placing them in plan 1/2. Consider multiple indexes.

2. **GERPE/UE Planning**:
   - Plan around core/MPE mods, ensuring no clashes. Place these in plan 3.

3. **Submitting Plans**:
   - Submit plans independently. Submitting plan 1 does not submit plans 2 or 3.
   - Only submit plans containing desired mods.

4. **Oversubscription**:
   - The STARS planner lists highly oversubscribed mods. If low on the priority list, securing these mods is unlikely.

5. **Exam Date Planning**:
   - Use the STARS planner to avoid exam date clashes, especially crucial for engineering students with many finals.

6. **Registration Date/Time**:
   - Check your personalised registration date/time based on your academic standing. Do not miss your registration time.

## STARWARS Day

1. **Preparation**:
   - Log in before your allocated time. Verify plans and ensure a stable internet connection.

2. **Split Screen**:
   - Display two tabs: one with the world clock (Singapore time) and another with the STARS page.

3. **Submitting Plans**:
   - Submit plans 1 and 2 first for core/MPE indexes (fastest fingers first).
   - Submit plan 3 after securing core/MPE mods. Rank GERPE/UE preferences and submit.

4. **Waitlist Strategy**:
   - Periodically resubmit choices if mods are not secured. Alternatively, continuously spam the submit button.
